It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular, do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided and an error happens,\n   * it will be thrown asynchronously. Errors thrown asynchronously cannot be caught using `try`/`catch`. Instead,\n   * use the {@link onUnhandledError} configuration option or use a runtime handler (like `window.onerror` or\n   * `process.on('error)`) to be notified of unhandled errors. Because of this, it's recommended that you provide\n   * an `error` method to avoid missing thrown errors.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of an Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to the `error` function, as with an Observer, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown asynchronously.\n   *\n   * You can, however, subscribe with no parameters at all. This may be the case where you're not interested in terminal events\n   * and you also handled emissions internally by using operators (e.g. using `tap`).\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() {\n   *     // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *     // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   *   .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs'\n   *\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3).subscribe(\n   *   value => {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum)\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```ts\n   * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const subscription = interval(1000).subscribe({\n   *   next(num) {\n   *     console.log(num)\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     // Will not be called, even when cancelling subscription.\n   *     console.log('completed!');\n   *   }\n   * });\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

As a second argument it takes string that indicates\n * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,\n * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,\n * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.\n * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event\n * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type\n * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.\n *\n * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered\n * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value\n * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.\n * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.\n *\n * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second\n * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,\n * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments\n * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,\n * instead of the usual value.\n *\n * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that\n * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,\n * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided\n * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes\n * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still\n * a good choice.\n *\n * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed\n * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually\n * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * instead.\n *\n * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:\n *\n * **DOM EventTarget**\n *\n * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.\n *\n * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event\n * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,\n * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When\n * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n * as third parameter as well.\n *\n * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n *\n * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n *\n * **JQuery-style event target**\n *\n * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n *\n * **DOM NodeList**\n *\n * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n *\n * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable\n * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.\n *\n * **DOM HtmlCollection**\n *\n * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is\n * installed and removed in each of elements.\n *\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Emits clicks happening on the DOM document\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // Results in:\n * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click\n * // occurs on the document.\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use addEventListener with capture option\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const clicksInDocument = fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter\n *                                                              // which will be passed to addEventListener\n * const clicksInDiv = fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');\n *\n * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));\n * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));\n *\n * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally\n * // when we would click on div in document\n * // \"div\" would be logged first and then \"document\".\n * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document\n * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console\n * // will log \"document\" and then \"div\".\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link bindCallback}\n * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * @see {@link fromEventPattern}\n *\n * @param {FromEventTarget<T>} target The DOM EventTarget, Node.js\n * EventEmitter, JQuery-like event target, NodeList or HTMLCollection to attach the event handler to.\n * @param {string} eventName The event name of interest, being emitted by the\n * `target`.\n * @param {EventListenerOptions} [options] Options to pass through to addEventListener\n * @return {Observable<T>}\n */\nexport function fromEvent<T>(\n  target: any,\n  eventName: string,\n  options?: EventListenerOptions | ((...args: any[]) => T),\n  resultSelector?: (...args: any[]) => T\n): Observable<T> {\n  if (isFunction(options)) {\n    resultSelector = options;\n    options = undefined;\n  }\n  if (resultSelector) {\n    return fromEvent<T>(target, eventName, options as EventListenerOptions).pipe(mapOneOrManyArgs(resultSelector));\n  }\n\n  // Figure out our add and remove methods.

While you _could_ perform side-effects\n * inside of a `map` or a `mergeMap`, that would make their mapping functions impure, which isn't always a big deal, but will\n * make it so you can't do things like memoize those functions. The `tap` operator is designed solely for such side-effects to\n * help you remove side-effects from other operations.\n *\n * For any notification, next, error, or complete, `tap` will call the appropriate callback you have provided to it, via a function\n * reference, or a partial observer, then pass that notification down the stream.\n *\n * The observable returned by `tap` is an exact mirror of the source, with one exception: Any error that occurs -- synchronously -- in a handler\n * provided to `tap` will be emitted as an error from the returned observable.\n *\n * > Be careful! You can mutate objects as they pass through the `tap` operator's handlers.\n *\n * The most common use of `tap` is actually for debugging. You can place a `tap(console.log)` anywhere\n * in your observable `pipe`, log out the notifications as they are emitted by the source returned by the previous\n * operation.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Check a random number before it is handled. Below is an observable that will use a random number between 0 and 1,\n * and emit \"big\" or \"small\" depending on the size of that number. But we wanted to log what the original number\n * was, so we have added a `tap(console.log)`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { tap, map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * of(Math.random()).pipe(\n *   tap(console.log),\n *   map(n => n > 0.5 ? 'big' : 'small')\n * ).subscribe(console.log);\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n * Using `tap` to analyze a value and force an error. Below is an observable where in our system we only\n * want to emit numbers 3 or less we get from another source. We can force our observable to error\n * using `tap`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const source = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n *\n * source.pipe(\n *  tap(n => {\n *    if (n > 3) {\n *      throw new TypeError(`Value ${n} is greater than 3`)\n *    }\n *  })\n * )\n * .subscribe(console.log);\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n * We want to know when an observable completes before moving on to the next observable. The system\n * below will emit a random series of `\"X\"` characters from 3 different observables in sequence.
